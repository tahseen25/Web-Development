  <h1>Love and War</h1>

  <p>I used to think I've had enough,<br>
    I can't let anyone in again.<br>
    So when I saw you,<br>
    I started to build my walls,<br>
    But then I realized<br>
    I was a bit late.<br>
    You were already there,<br>
    Right next to me.</p>

  <p>If you can break through my walls,<br>
    I thought you might be the one,<br>
    But you were very different,<br>
    Not what I imagined you to be.</p>

  <p>You questioned my beliefs,<br>
    You made me think I might be wrong,<br>
    Well, I did the same to you,<br>
    And we were breaking one another,<br>
    And building us again, anew.</p>

  <p>Well, I kind of liked it,<br>
    Until we were standing<br>
    On complete opposite sides,<br>
    On different grounds,<br>
    Now it was a war,<br>
    We both wanted to win.</p>

  <p>I said, "I am the reason<br>
    You won't win this war."<br>
    You said, "Battle's over,<br>
    Your kingdom is mine."</p>

  <p>I stabbed you with my sword,<br>
    My kingdom was all I was left with,<br>
    I would lose everything if I lost,<br>
    I watched you bleed, but I had no choice,<br>
    It was either you or me,<br>
    We couldn't exist together,<br>
    So I left, you were on your own now.</p>

  <p>I had my kingdom back,<br>
    I had my peace back,<br>
    I had my loneliness back,<br>
    I had my walls rebuilt,<br>
    I got the news, you survived.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I think that I should have<br>
    Let you break my walls,<br>
    Watch you destroy what I built, what I loved.<br>
    Cause I loved you more than anything.<br>
    I know you wouldn't have gone that far.<br>
    Cause you loved me more than anything,<br>
    But I was never that brave.</p>

  <p>So I tried my best to forget you,<br>
    And as they say,<br>
    Time is the best healer,<br>
    I forgot you, you forgot me.<br>
    Now we were past, just a story,<br>
    No pain, no hate.</p>

  <p>You might think<br>
    What was the point of all this.<br>
    Well, you made me a better me,<br>
    I made you a better you.<br>
    Somethings are<br>
    just not meant to be.<br>
    But we are much better<br>
    than what we were.<br>
    And I guess it's our happy ending.</p>
