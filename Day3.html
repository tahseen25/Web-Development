  <h1>Day 3</h1>

  <p>She woke up as she planned to go to college and come back to Mamu's house but it was inconvenient she decided to go to college with her Mumma, quickly do the submissions, look for nearby hostels and then go shopping with her Mumma at FC road.</p>

  <p>She insisted on going by bus this time so that she can know the way, and there was no time constraints and she had her Mumma with her. So that she didn't have to waste money every time she came by auto.</p>

  <p>It was a long day, they didn't know which bus goes where, made some wrong decisions, some mistakes, learned few things but now she was confident that she can travel by bus alone next time. So it was all worth it.</p>

  <p>They had seen 3 hostels, she wanted to go to the one where her classmate lived in, there were good facilities there too.</p>

  <p>About shopping; she never likes anything in those shops, her Mumma has to insist her to buy a few clothes, so she did. But she was really tired after reaching home. She freshened up and slept for a long time.</p>

  <p>When she woke up, her sister had already had dinner, and they were planning to go for a walk. She went to have dinner when she completed eating her sister's came back, they watched a movie together, then discussed Doraemon, chatted for a while, and went to sleep.</p>
