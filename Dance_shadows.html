  <h1>Dark Room</h1>

  <p>In a room so dark, with shadows stark,<br>
    A canvas stained, emotions parked.<br>
    Last thing you'd want, first thing to do,<br>
    Drowning in black, hiding the true.</p>

  <p>Glass shards crushed, beneath a shoe,<br>
    Pain concealed, but it still grew.<br>
    Blood on the floor, a silent war,<br>
    Wounds unclean, infecting more.</p>

  <p>Salt not sugar, the taste is bitter,<br>
    Lost in thoughts, can't find a glitter.<br>
    Down south we go, deep and wide,<br>
    A journey begun, no need to hide.</p>

  <p>Chill in the air, abyss below,<br>
    Yet forward we move, courage to show.<br>
    Whispers from the abyss, in shadows we trust,<br>
    A tale unfolds, in the darkness thrust.</p>
