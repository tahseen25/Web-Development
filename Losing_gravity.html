  <h1>Losing Gravity</h1>

  <p>One mistake and you lose all validation,<br>
    And it turns worst when you know that you are the only one to blame for this.<br>
    That you are the one that disappointed everyone,<br>
    When you have seen all the efforts they put in, and then you see their eyes dim.</p>

  <p>And just like that everything turns cold,<br>
    Past is frozen,<br>
    You lose your ground,<br>
    Gravity.<br>
    Now everything is just floating,<br>
    So you'll have to bring back the gravity,<br>
    Before you even fall.<br>
    You can't be heard.<br>
    Maybe it's all in your head,<br>
    but it's all you've got.</p>

  <p>So bring back the gravity,<br>
    So you can wake up from this dream.<br>
    The gravity's lost,<br>
    You don't know the path,<br>
    The oblivion and a hole big black.<br>
    Lost the sense of time,<br>
    But it's running out.<br>
    Bring back the gravity,<br>
    Before you can cry,<br>
    Or it'll hurt your eye.</p>

  <p>You get your,<br>
    Before you can complain,<br>
    Or it's just a waste of time.<br>
    Lost everything,<br>
    This is just a dream.<br>
    Please bring back the gravity,<br>
    Before you lose all your energy.<br>
    You'll be stuck in here forever,<br>
    So bring back the gravity,<br>
    Before you lose yourself too.</p>
