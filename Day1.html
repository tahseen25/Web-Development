  <h1>The Decade Begins</h1>

  <p>I'll tell you a story of a girl who just turned 20 yesterday. If you want to know if she's a good person or a bad one, a mediocre person or a successful one, rich or poor, smart or dumb, mature or childish... I'll let you decide for yourself as you read the story.</p>

  <p>It was her birthday yesterday and also her last insem paper in mechanics. So she woke up in the morning, got ready, like took some effort for once, and went for the exam. Her best friend wished her a happy birthday, and many other friends who noticed that she looked different today also wished her. In the exam, she did well except for when she put a plus sign in the calculator instead of minus. She is like this, always does something to ruin all the efforts.</p>

  <p>Anyways, then she got back to the room and got ready to go to Mamu's house. Called her mom after booking the cab. Her mummy was also on the way. Reached Mamu's house after half an hour. Everyone wished her as soon as she opened the door; she said thank you with a smile. Then she chatted with her sister Zoya while waiting for her other sister Jiya, who was taking a bath. But she fell asleep before Jiya came out.</p>

  <p>She was woken up by her sister's voice, Riza. Yep. That meant her mother and Riza had reached home. She hugged her sister, went out talked to her mother, and then they all chatted for a while. After some time she got ready, everyone got ready. It was time to cut the cake. Mumani had brought the cake. Everyone got ready. They clicked pictures, many pictures. Her and Jiya's pictures looked nice. The color of their dresses was contrast but yet synced perfectly with each other. Then the cake was cut, eaten, pictures were clicked, birthday song was sung. Then they went to the restaurant "Desi Chulha". They were stuck in traffic for a really long time. They ordered the food, three dishes Mumtaj, Suleman, and Desi chicken chulha, ate it, came back. She called her father after reaching home.</p>

  <p>While they were stuck in traffic, her Mumani said that they should have video called Pappa while cutting the cake, so he could also join in. It reminded her that she was not a filial daughter; she didn't even call him once after Riza and Mummy reached home. It was like she completely forgot him. She decided to call him as soon as they reach home. But she hated the fact that if it wasn't for her Mumani, she would have completely forgotten her father. She talked with Pappa for a really short time.</p>

  <p>Then she took out her phone and started looking at the pictures. They were really good she thought. A little extra effort to look presentable doesn't go to waste. Her Mumani was the one who had convinced her to put on the lipstick, the Kajol, and the earrings. (She rarely wears any earrings. So the holes in her ear have become really small. Her Mumani was helping her put on her earrings. Her mumma was also there. Her Mumani asked her does it hurt, she said 'a little bit,' her Mumani joked, then why didn't she say anything. Her Mother who knew her the best said that that's how it is always like with her. Never saying anything.)</p>

  <p>As she was looking at the pictures, she realized that she didn't look half as bad as she thought she did. And that also made her think that she had judged herself based on her beauty, does she do that to other people too? This is a very bad thing. It is a person's heart that matters, not their face; then why was she feeling good if she looked nice? Why was that she was feeling more confident and more comfortable with herself, just because she looked nice? Is she a bad person, who judges people by how they look?</p>
