  <h1>Echoes in Stone</h1>

  <p>Upon the mountain, standing tall,<br>
    Grey-white building, proud in all.<br>
    A decade's tale within its walls,<br>
    From youth's mischief to wisdom's calls.</p>

  <p>In every corner, memories reside,<br>
    Of art and stories, in it, I confide.<br>
    Through fall and rise, drama's spin,<br>
    A sanctuary where I found my kin.</p>

  <p>Soulmates met in its embrace,<br>
    Lessons learned, a sacred space.<br>
    Whispers linger as I pass on by,<br>
    Long live the echoes, reaching the sky.</p>

  <p>No longer its gates I tread,<br>
    Yet, in my heart, it's never fled.<br>
    A timeless bond, forever true,<br>
    Grey-white building, I salute to you.</p>

  <p>As I stroll by, it whispers my name,<br>
    In every brick, my story's claim.<br>
    A symphony in stone, a lifelong friend,<br>
    "Echoes in Stone," the tale's sweet blend.</p>
