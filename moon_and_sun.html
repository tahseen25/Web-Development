  <h1>Moon and Sun</h1>

  <p>"You know, there was a time in my life when I was feeling down, and I found solace in the moon. But now, I've come to appreciate the sun, especially its radiant rise. I'm embracing this new version of myself. However, it seems that you're making me fall for the moon again.</p>

  <p>During that time, my emotions could swing from laughter to tears in an instant, you know? I used to grasp the meaning behind every sad song, but now I mostly enjoy uplifting tunes. So, please don't enter my life if you don't intend to stay. I don't want to go through those ups and downs again. Yet, paradoxically, I find myself yearning for that emotional roller coaster once more.</p>

  <p>It's not your fault; I see you as perfect. I just wish you wouldn't be so kind to me, as it makes me wonder if you'd treat other girls the same way. I don't want to waste my time obsessing over you, but unfortunately, thoughts of you consume my mind.</p>

  <p>I feel comfortable abiding by the rules, staying within the lines, but lately, my thoughts wander into forbidden territories like a lost traveler in a forbidden forest. So, please disregard my messages; I'm already regretting sending them. I've made a promise to myself not to do anything I won't admit to, and you'll be the one thing I won't confess to."</p>
