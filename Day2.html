  <h1>Day 2</h1>

  <p>She woke up when her Mumma was looking for her phone, she gave a ring to Mumma's phone through her mobile and slept back and then woke up after 5 min. She brushed her teeth, and then they all had breakfast after Jiya came out.</p>

  <p>After breakfast, she took her Mumm's phone and transferred many of their old pictures; she had very few pictures in her phone. As she was looking at the pictures. She came across her pictures(from Goa) that she didn't like before, but as she was looking at them now she realized there was nothing wrong in those photos, they were perfect, they were all her, captured in that moment. Her eyes, her nose, her lips, her dark spots, her scars, her smile, her gaze it was all her. And it was delightful to meet past her after such a long time. Now she liked all those photos of her. They were not something she should ignore, no more.</p>

  <p>Then she took her laptop and completed a course on Canva. She was thinking of starting freelancing. She was sure she wanted to start freelancing. She was not just sure how, if she should try writing or designing...</p>

  <p>She saw her sister's, Riza and Zoya playing Uno. She joined them. Played with them for a while and then went back to complete her course. After completing the course, she thought she will have to do some more research as the options given at the end of the course might need some experience. But who will hire her if no one hired her. She came to the conclusion that she needed to do more research.</p>

  <p>Then she heard that Jiya was going to do namaz with Nani and Jiya had already completed her day's lecture and has bathed. Then She remembered she wanted to perform Namaz on her birthday and had decided to learn how to do it. But because of exams, it didn't happen. She told her Mumma she was going to bathe.</p>

  <p>Then her mother started the geyser for her. Then she went into the bathroom. While bathing she thought that it really did not matter how she looked perfect in those photos it was not about her, but about the moment and the feelings that were perfect. She decided that next time her mother asked her to click pictures she won't deny, she will not cover her face. Her mother really took efforts to click her one decent picture in which she did not make faces. Though she had realized yesterday sometimes it was really difficult for her to fake smile for photos, maybe because she forgot that the essence was the moment and not the picture. Now she will keep in mind that photos are just a timestop to save the moment for later, no burden to look perfect, the moment was itself perfect. She also thought how those old unattractive pictures of her don't bother her anymore, as if it was her but also not her at the same. It was like an audio playing in her ears, she had heard once, it said that ' If I start telling at you in a language you don't understand will it bother you? If I star speaking ill of your blue hair will it bother you? It won't cause you know it's not her.' In the same way, she knew now that she didn't look that bad so what if her pictures not so good. She also realized that you don't understand something completely unless you already realized it. Like she had heard the audio. She thought she already knew that and there was nothing SHE was doing wrong in this aspect. Unless, she realized how wrong she was. That she didn't realize it until she actually did? Then who was she to judge anyone, that they were ignorant? Wasn't she the same? Clueless? About her feelings. (Also about her surroundings but it is a talk for later) She came out of the bathroom.</p>

  <p>Then they had lunch. There was no chicken piece left for her, so Riza gave her hers; she thanked her by kissing Riza on the cheek, they say and ate. Then Jiya wanted to watch Spiderman movie that was in her laptop. So she took her laptop and they both started watching the movie, but halfway through the movie the laptop showed a battery low notification, and she had forgotten to bring the charger, then they switched it off. They decided to watch Hotel Delluna instead. Jiya had already completed watching 1st and more than half of the second episode, so Jiya gave her a run-through it and they continued watching the second episode, they also completed the third episode and then they stopped. They came out of the room chatted for a while, when Riza, Zoya, and Mumma returned. They had brought ice creams. So all of them are Icecream in Gallery. And then went in. Then she talked and talked with her Mumma. And then she started writing her diary. While Jiya did her own things and Riza and Zoya were playing. Then they all watched Dhruv Tara together. Then she completed her assignments and went to bed.</p>
